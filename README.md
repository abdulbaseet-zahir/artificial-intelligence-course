# Artificial Intelligence Course

Welcome to this course on deep learning and its applications. In this course, you will learn how to use deep learning techniques to solve various problems, such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech synthesis, and more. You will also learn how to use deep learning models using Python and popular frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. By the end of this course, you will be able to create production-ready projects that showcase your deep learning skills.

This course is designed for learners who have some basic knowledge of Python and are interested in exploring the exciting field of deep learning. This course is not intended to teach you the mathematical and computer science foundations of deep learning, but rather to give you a practical and hands-on introduction to the topic. If you want to refresh your math and computer science background, you can check out other online resources.

> The title of this course is deliberately misleading, as it should be more accurately called Introduction to Deep Learning Applications. This course will focus on the practical aspects of using deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems, rather than the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence.
