    "\n",
    "- Machine learning can train on smaller data sets, while deep learning requires large amounts of data to learn from.\n",
    "- Machine learning requires more human intervention to correct and learn from mistakes, while deep learning learns on its own from the environment and past experiences.\n",
    "- Machine learning makes simple, linear correlations between inputs and outputs, while deep learning makes non-linear, complex correlations that can capture hidden patterns and features.\n",
    "- Machine learning can train on a CPU, while deep learning needs a specialized GPU to handle the high computational complexity of neural networks.\n",
    "- Machine learning is a broader field that includes many subtypes, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, while deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.\n"
